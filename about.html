            <p style="animation: 2s ease-out 1s 1 load; animation-fill-mode: backwards;"><span class="focus">Jesse
                </span> was fascinated by computers from a very young age. At age six, he created a simple "make it to
                the end" game that did not at all resemble Snakes and Ladders. It was Jesse's first experience
                experimenting with a format and trying to “find the fun.”</p>
            <p style="animation: 2s ease-out 1.5s 1 load; animation-fill-mode: backwards;">Jesse continued pursuing his
                interest in computer science at <span class="focus">URJ 6 Points Sci-Tech Academy</span>, a science and
                technology camp. There, Jesse first learned how to code (Processing/Java) and the basics of how to
                create games. He took the Video Game Design workshop five times as a camper and returned for many years
                as a staff and leadership member.</p>
            <p style="animation: 2s ease-out 2s 1 load; animation-fill-mode: backwards;">During his time at <span
                    class="focus">Wesleyan
                    University,</span> Jesse took an intensive course on the game design process taught by <span
                    class="focus">Professor Christopher Weaver</span>, founder of Bethesda Softworks. This course
                challenged teams of coders, designers, and artists, to create an educational children's video game,
                which would be playtested at a local elementary school. His team's game, <a class="focus"
                    style="text-decoration: none;" href="games/oneearth.html">One Earth</a>, won the competition. In
                following semesters, Jesse became a course assistant to support future students in the creation of their
                games and to iteratively refine the course curriculum. Jesse graduated from Wesleyan in May of 2024,
                with a double major in Computer Science and Music, a minor in Film, and a focus on game design. In his
                final semesters, he supported the development of the Game Design minor at Wesleyan.</p>
            <p style="animation: 2s ease-out 2.5s 1 load; animation-fill-mode: backwards;">Currently, Jesse is a
                software engineer at <span class="focus">PwC</span> in Boston, MA, where he works
                on internal AI projects for the streamlining of processes in the firm.</p>
