            <p style="animation: 2s ease-out 1s 1 load; animation-fill-mode: backwards;"><span class="focus">Jesse </span> was born on November 1, 2002, in Miami, Florida. He grew
                up on Long Island, New York, and was fascinated by computers from a very young age. His first consoles,
                like many others his age, were the Nintendo DS and Wii, with which he played games like Pokemon and The
                Legend of Zelda, widening what he thought was possible with computers. From the start, Jesse wanted to
                actually make games; he made his very first board game when he was 6 years old, a simple "make it to the
                end" type game that did not at all resemble Snakes and Ladders, which he drew with marker on some poster
                paper that he then laminated. It was a 3-player game, as he noticed that almost all board games went
                down to two, and he wanted to change the format.</p>
            <p style="animation: 2s ease-out 1.5s 1 load; animation-fill-mode: backwards;">Jesse owes a lot of his continued interest in computer science to the camps he went to as a child, most
                prominently <span class="focus">URJ 6 Points Sci-Tech Academy</span>, a Jewish science and technology
                camp in Massachusetts. It was there that Jesse first learned how to code (Processing/Java) and some of
                the basics of game design. He would end up taking the Video Game Design workshop five times in his few
                years there, and would return back many years later as a staff and leadership member.</p>
            <p style="animation: 2s ease-out 2s 1 load; animation-fill-mode: backwards;">Jesse's interest in computer science continued well into high school and into his time at <span
                    class="focus">Wesleyan University</span> in Middletown, CT. There, he took an intensive course on
                the game design process taught by <span class="focus">Professor Christopher Weaver</span>, founder of
                Bethesda Softworks. This course put students into multi-disciplinary teams of coders, designers, and
                artists, with the challenge of creating an educational children's video game over the course of three
                months. This game was playtested at a local elementary school and would eventually become <a
                    class="focus" style="text-decoration: none;" href="games/oneearth.html">One Earth</a>, the winning game of the semester as determined
                by a panel of professionals. In following semesters, Jesse became a course assistant for the course, and
                would reinforce his passion for education while working with Professor Weaver. Jesse graduated from
                Wesleyan in May of 2024, with a double major in Computer Science and Music, a minor in Film, and a focus
                on game design. He was present for the first few talks of developing a Game Design minor at Wesleyan;
                unfortunately, he would graduate before it was formalized.</p>
            <p style="animation: 2s ease-out 2.5s 1 load; animation-fill-mode: backwards;">Currently, Jesse is a software engineer at <span class="focus">PwC</span> in Boston, MA, where he works
                on internal AI projects for the streamlining of processes in the firm.</p>
