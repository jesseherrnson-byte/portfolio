            <p><span class="focus">INK</span> is a game that I originally created in school, but soon became my largest
                personal project. The original pitch was to create a game that taught children about the concept of
                failure –– that it wasn't something to be scared of, but an opportunity for further experimentation and
                exploration. This developed into a fairly simple concept: an inky black blob in a white room with white
                walls. The blob can be launched, and whenever it hits a wall, it leaves a splatter and dissovles,
                respawning at the beginning of the level. Every time the player "dies," they have the opportunity to try
                again, with just a little more information than they had last time.</p>

            <div class="body-text" style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:10px;">
                <p>Since the creation of the original idea, I have designed roughly 100 levels for INK, all utilizing
                    different concepts and the four different power-ups which change the behavior (and color) of the
                    inky character blob. I designed these each on small sticky notes, meticulously noting what was in
                    each level, and then reorganizing them in order to ensure a good difficulty curve. I worked in
                    collaboration with art programmer <span class="focus">Junior Siguencia,</span> who ensured the game
                    had a cohesive visual style, with a sleek, simplistic feel.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right:20px;">In addition to the main programming and physics systems for
                the game, I also worked on the music and sound design. I created an adaptive sound system which altered
                the background music based on which power-ups the player had collected throughout the course of a level.
                While composing the music and designing the sound effects, I aimed for a very simple, lo-fi sound to
                complement the game's visual style.</p>
