                <p><span class="focus">One Earth</span> was a game I worked on when taking IDEA350, an intensive course
                    on game design and development taught by Professor Christopher Weaver at Wesleyan Univesristy. In
                    the course, I was in a team of 5, with two other artists/designers and two other coders. We were
                    tasked with developing an educational video game for elementary school age children within the
                    course of three months. Our team leader picthed a game centered on sustainability, which became One
                    Earth, named as such for the fact that it would take five Earths worth of resources to sustain the
                    world if everyone consumed the amount of the average American.</p>

            <div class="body-text" style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:10px;">
                <p>One Earth focused on teaching kids about the different ways to dispose of items, and the differences
                    between trash, recycling, compost, e-waste, etc. The goal: reduce the five Earths metric down to
                    just one by utilizing sustainable habits. The gameplay focused on kids identifying which bins items
                    were supposed to go to and picking them up around the map. As they put more items into the correct
                    bins, their score would decrease and the Earths would wane until there was only one left.

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right:20px; margin-top:20px;">As a coder/designer for this project, I
                was tasked with developing the speech and text system for interacting with NPCs, scoring systems, and
                main gameplay. Upon our team's realization that the original gameplay might be a bit too monotonous, I
                proposed to the team leader that we develop three unlockable minigames to break up the gameplay and
                teach different concepts. I designed, along with the other artist, these three minigames, which taught
                students how plastic bottles were recycled, how compost was used, and how batteries and e-waste were
                reclaimed. These minigames were vital to our game winning the course, as a panel of professors and game
                industry professionals appreciated their approach to teaching. This course taught me how to work in a
                multi-disciplinary team and the basics of a Scrum/Agile workflow, along with increasing my knowledge in
                Unity and C#.</p>
