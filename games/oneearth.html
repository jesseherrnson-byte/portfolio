                <p><span class="focus">One Earth</span> was a game I worked on when taking IDEA350, an intensive course
                    on game design and development taught by Professor Christopher Weaver at Wesleyan University. In the
                    course, I was in a team of five, with two other artists/designers and two other coders. We were
                    tasked with developing an educational video game for elementary school age children. Our game was
                    One Earth, named as such for the fact that it would take five Earths worth of resources to sustain
                    the world if everyone consumed the amount of the average American, with the goal being to reduce
                    that number down to one.</p>

            <div class="body-text" style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:10px;">
                <p>One Earth focuses on teaching kids about the different ways to dispose of items, and the differences
                    between trash, recycling, compost, e-waste, etc. The goal: reduce the five Earths metric down to
                    just one by utilizing sustainable habits. The gameplay is focused on kids identifying which bins
                    items were supposed to go to and picking them up around the map. As they put more items into the
                    correct bins, their score decreases and the Earths wane until there is only one left.

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right:20px; margin-top:20px;">As a coder/designer for this project, I
                developed the speech and text system for interacting with NPCs, scoring systems, and main gameplay. Upon
                our team's realization that the original gameplay might be a bit too monotonous, I proposed we develop
                three unlockable minigames to break up the gameplay and teach different concepts. I designed, along with
                the other artist, these three minigames, which taught students how plastic bottles were recycled, how
                compost was used, and how batteries and e-waste were reclaimed. These minigames were vital to our game
                winning the course, as a panel of professors and game industry professionals appreciated its approach to
                teaching. This course taught me how to work in a multi-disciplinary team and the basics of a Scrum/Agile
                workflow, along with increasing my knowledge in Unity and C#.</p>
