            <p><span class="focus">Cantoludus</span> is an educational deck-building card game designed to teach
                elementary music theory concepts. I co-designed the game while taking a course called Educational Gaming
                Lab at Wesleyan University. We were tasked with creating any kind of educational game that utilized
                concepts from the class, so we chose to aim our game at high school/college age students who are in
                intro level music theory courses.</p>

                <p>Cantoludus was designed to be a teaching tool that could be used intermittently throughout the course
                    of a course. It is modular; after students have a lesson on intervals, they can play the base
                    version of the game. Then, once they learn about scales and chords, they can add the chord cards to
                    the deck. Then they can include progressions, then hide chord makeups -- so on and so forth,
                    depending on the class' needs on that given day.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right:20px;">In the game, players start with a simple deck of just one
                of each note, plus sharps and flats. In the middle is the "Orchestra" where they can "buy" new cards by
                combining the ones in their hand. They then add the bought cards to their deck, and can play them when
                drawn. The goal is to gain enough "Impression Points" by collecting and playing cards strategically in
                order to beat the other player. You can check out <a class="focus" style="text-decoration: none;"

                <p>As a little bonus (and inspired by the recent release of Balatro), I ended up making a little <span
                        class="focus">digital mockup</span> of the game in Unity. This version was only a prototype, but
                    it demonstrated some additional learning potential –– when cards were played, they would actually
                    make the sound they represent, reinforcing to players what different intervals or chords sounded
                    like. It was also easier to implement the "blind chords" mode in a digital format.</p>
