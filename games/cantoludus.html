            <p><span class="focus">Cantoludus</span> is an educational deck-building card game designed to help high
                school and college students teach elementary music theory concepts. I co-designed the game with <span
                    class="focus">Maze Labowitz</span> while taking a course called Educational Gaming Lab at Wesleyan
                University.</p>

                <p>Cantoludus was designed to be a teaching tool that could be used intermittently throughout class. It
                    is modular; after students have a lesson on intervals (the spaces between notes), they can play the
                    base version of the game with the interval cards. Once they learn about scales and chords, they can
                    add the chord cards to the deck. They can also include progressions, or hide chord makeups –– so on
                    and so forth, depending on the class' needs each day.</p>

            <p>Players start with a simple deck of cards with one of each
                note, plus two sharp and flat cards. In the middle of the play area is the "Orchestra" where players can
                "buy" new cards by combining the ones in their hand. Players then add the bought cards to their deck and
                can play them when drawn. The goal is to gain enough "Impression Points" by collecting and playing cards
                strategically in order to beat the other player. You can view <a class="focus"

                <p>As a little bonus (and inspired by the recent release of Balatro), I ended up making a small <span
                        class="focus">digital prototype</span> of the game in Unity. This version was only a prototype,
                    but it demonstrated some additional learning potential –– when cards were played, they would
                    actually make the sound they represent, reinforcing to players what different intervals or chords
                    sounded like.</p>
