                <p style="margin-top:0;"">The <span class=" focus">DW Index</span> (short for<i>Doctor Who</i>Index) is
                    a long running TV data analysis project I started a few years ago with my friend Emma Bram. I'm a
                    big fan of the revival of the TV show<i>Doctor Who</i>; it was one of the first reasons that caused
                    me to
                    study film and screenwriting. I would always make improvements to the episodes in my head and
                    imagine what the most compelling times and setpieces would be for the show.

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right:20px; margin-top:0;">The DW Index was formed from a specific idea:
                what is the perfect episode of <i>Doctor Who?</i> What traits are theoretically more favorable than
                others? Which villains are typically more liked? To answer these, we took every episode of the revived
                show, categorized all the traits we saw, and labelled "Yes", "No", or "Eh" for each trait for each
                episode. My partner and I then rated every episode out of 10, and combined those with a variety of
                ratings (the UK Appreciation Index, IMDb, Reddit, the latter two of which are live scraped from the
                internet) to get a combined score, and used those scores to analyze patterns across the show.</p>

                <p>The DW Index currently has 16,050 yes/no data points for 84 categories. It pinpoints trends for
                    different categories across episodes, indicating what features are favorable to viewers. The index
                    also predicts what the scores will be for both real episodes (and note the difference between the
                    prediction and actual scores), as well as the scores for theoretical episodes. For each episode, the
                    DW Index also provides a summary (left) of the episode's writer(s), director, characters, scores, as
                    well as its most beneficial, least beneficial, and most unique features. All of this functionality
                    is done natively in Google Sheets, with no external code.</p>
