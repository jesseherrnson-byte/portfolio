            <p style="margin-bottom:0;">This website was created entirely using HTML and CSS –– no templates or
                anything, all made by me. HTML was actually one of the first languages I ever got exposed to, but this
                was certainly the largest project I've created utilizing HTML and CSS from scratch without any framework
                around it.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom:0;">As I've continued my career in software engineering, I have become more and more
                fascinated with UI/UX design, especially because of its overlap with game design. This website was a
                good opportunity for me to play around with some design principles in a sandbox environment.</p>
